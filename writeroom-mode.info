1 Writeroom-mode
****************

`writeroom-mode' is a minor mode for Emacs that implements a
distraction-free writing mode similar to the famous Writeroom editor
for OS X. `writeroom-mode' is meant for GNU Emacs 24 and won't run on
older versions.

1.1 Usage
=========

Install `writeroom-mode.el' in the usual way and activate it in a
buffer by calling `M-x writeroom-mode RET'. By default,
`writeroom-mode' does the following things:

   * activate fullscreen

   * disable transparency

   * disable the tool bar

   * disable the scroll bar

   * disable the fringes

   * disable the mode line

   * add window margins to the current buffer so that the text is 80
     characters wide.

The last three effects are buffer-local. The other effects apply to the
current frame. Because `writeroom-mode' is a minor mode, this isn't
entirely on the up and up, since minor modes aren't supposed to have
such global effects. But `writeroom-mode' is meant for distraction-free
writing, so these effects do make sense. Besides, if you're in the mood
for writing without distractions, you're not going to switch from the
buffer holding your text anyway, are you now? ;-)

All effects listed above can be switched off separately in the
customization group `writeroom'. Fullscreen, transparency, scroll-bar
and tool-bar can be switched off by removing the relevant functions
from `writeroom-global-functions', the other effects have a
corresponding toggle. The width of the text area is controlled by the
option `writeroom-width'. It can be an absolute value, in which case it
indicates the number of columns, or it can be a relative value. In that
case, it should be a number between 0 and 1.

It is possible to activate `writeroom-mode' in more than one buffer.
The global effects are of course activated only once and they remain
active until `writeroom-mode' is deactivated in _all_ buffers.

The option `writeroom-global-functions' can be used to add additional
global effects. Just write a function for enabling and disabling the
relevant effect and add it to the list. See the doc string of this
option for some more details.

1.2 Fullscreen limitations
==========================

Fullscreen as implemented here only works on Linux. It can be made to
work on OS X as well, if you compile Emacs with the patches from
`ftp://ftp.math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp/emacs/'. Alternatively, OS X has its
own way of making windows fullscreen:
`http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4530'.
